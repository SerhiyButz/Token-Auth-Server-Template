A Vapor server that uses token-based authentication. The client side is represented by the repository [Token-Auth-Client-Template](https://github.com/serhiybutz/Token-Auth-Client-Template.git), which is an iOS app. Since the server uses an SQLite database, no Docker installation is required.

### How to run

1. Clone the repository on the command line: `git clone https://github.com/serhiybutz/Token-Auth-Server-Template.git`.
2. Open it in Xcode (`open Package.swift`), wait for the Swift Package Manager dependencies to load, and start the server by hitting `CMD+r`.
3. Alternatively, you can build and run the server in Terminal by running the command in the server package directory: `swift run`.
